  paragraphOne:
    'Programming has always been my Achillesâ€™ heel and an area I want to explore but have been putting off for the longest time. Finally in July 2020, I purchased an online course to pursue my journey into the coding world. I started learning Python, Data Science and Machine Learning. I followed this up with web development courses focusing on the front-end using JavaScript and ReactJS, with a little bit of backend and database implementation.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'Prior to this, I spent that last twelve years working as an Electronics Technician in the oilfield services sector. The role has allowed me to gain various skills and competencies that have to do with repair and maintenance of different electronic tools, training and mentoring junior colleagues. It also gave me the opportunity to work outside of my home country, spending a good bit of time in the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia, where I met wonderful people from different backgrounds and cultures.',
